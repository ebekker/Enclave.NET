To run this sample, you need to run the `Enclave.ServiceHost`.

You also need to make sure the server and client Thumbprints referenced
in the settings file match those in the ServiceHost config.

If you generated the certs using the PS script included with the ServiceHost
then simply copy the `settings.local.json` file to this client app directory.
